        There are many cloud storage products on the market right now. I was
        tasked as the sole UX Designer to come up with the next new thing that
        could offer users a different experience. The solution, a product
        design that addresses the initial pain points of cloud service users,
        and a product that can compete in an overly saturated marketplace as
        an MVP.

        Users felt that their data could be vulnerable to outside entities

        for them. They also wanted the ability to multitask, collaborate and
        share data with colleagues. The client felt that with the right key

          Researching the top three competitors to discover their marketing
          strategies, primary audiences, and differentiators, allowed me to take
          a behind the scenes look into the world of cloud storage. The market
          is saturated with this type of product, making this concept easily
          duplicated.
          <strong>However, Apple iCloud far exceeds Google Drive and Dropbox in
            advanced technology. Dropbox, however, offers collaboration through
            different media and third-party apps. Google Drive starts its users
            out with a whopping 15GB of free storage</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="competitive-text2">
          Pricing seems to be comparable between the three. They all share
          common features, a new product could definitely compete if they added
          certain features the others didn’t offer and kept their rates
          competitive.

          <strong>Take away</strong>: More time with research could definitely
          be done in this area to flesh out more weaknesses that would allow a
          new business to produce an MVP that wouldn’t be so easily duplicated,
          giving them more of a chance to move to the front of the line.

        <h4 class="user-survey">USER SURVEY</h4>
        <p class="survey-text1">
          Once I was familiar with who the competition was and how they
          positioned themselves, I conducted a Google Forms User Survey to find
          out the main pain points of potential users, also to see if people
          really had the stomach for yet another cloud storage product. I used
          conditional logic in my questioning to flesh out who potential users
          might be.
        </p>

        <p class="survey-text2">
          What I learned from the (33) participants over a 72 hour period was:
        </p>

        <p class="survey-text3">
          -
          <strong>70% of the participants were knowledgeable about cloud storage
            services;</strong><br />
          -
          <strong>89% of the participants were most familiar with Google Drive and
            Dropbox;</strong><br />
          -
          <strong>87% were using 1 or more of the top three cloud services;</strong><br />
          -
          <strong>50% of the participants had no interest at all with this type of
            technology;</strong><br />
          -
          <strong>Majority of participants wanted newer technology applied to
            features;</strong><br />
          -
          <strong>felt privacy and security were their biggest concerns;</strong><br />
          -
          <strong>61% of participants were women between the ages of 21-40.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="take-away2">
          <strong>Take away</strong>: I learned from this data sample that
          people are generally happy with the services they are currently using,
          but do have concerns regarding security, privacy, and usability. They
          also would like to see newer technology applied to a new product
          that’s not currently being offered in the services they now have.
          There’s definitely a target audience that stood out from the sampling.
          A new product that addressed some of these pain points could
          definitely compete.

        Based on data from my research, I created user stories with the goal
        of allowing users to perform the various task within the MVP with as
        few clicks as possible. I provided roles for each user story. From
        these various roles and data from the user survey, I created about 23
        user stories in order of priority from high to low in order to come up
        with enough information to start the process of developing for an MVP.
      </p>

      <p class="take-away4">
        <strong>Take away</strong>: What I took from this process of creating
        individual user stories for each task, is that while creating them it
        allows you to really connect with your step process and internally
        visualize how to you will bring this MVP into fruition using this
        data.

      <h4 class="user-flows">USER FLOWS</h4>
      <p class="user-flow-text">
        With the MVP in mind, I then moved to create the user flows of the
        potential product. I visualized myself as the potential user
        performing the different tasks and how I could potentially get them
        done in as few clicks as possible. It was also at this time that I
        decided to design this product as a desktop website. I created eight
        user flows to show the following tasks:
      </p>

      <ol type="1">
        <li>Onboarding process</li>
        <li>Organize content</li>
        <li>Upload/save a file</li>

        <li>Search/Share a file</li>
        <li>Sync account</li>

      <p class="take-away5">
        <strong>Take away</strong>: Creating user flows is an important step
        in the process. Walking through the steps click by click allows you to

      <h4 class="content-strategy">CONTENT STRATEGY</h4>
      <p class="content-strategy-text1">
        With the user flows finished, I started my draft content strategy
        document. The challenge I ran into was that, I never really put any
        thought into the behind the scene process of what really goes into the
        making of a website, just point, click and ta-da! This part of the
        assignment up to this point gave me the most angst.
      </p>
      <p class="content-strategy-text2">
        I understood the premise behind the process of pulling together the
        “meat and potatoes” of each web page, but I struggled with the aspect
        of writing down every single word of the web page. So I pulled
        together the outline for my web content.
      </p>

      <p class="take-away6">
        <strong>Take away</strong>: The challenge of pulling together content
        and laying out the structure of your website is a very critical part
        of the process that definitely needs careful thought. I adapted into
        this process as time went on in the project. Taking the time to build
        a strong blueprint at this juncture was key.

      <p class="site-map-text">
        This is where I needed to visualize how I wanted things to be laid
        out. I needed to redefine a couple of things within the structure of
        the content document, like where hero statements should rest, and
        possible images that I might use, etc. Once I felt that I had nailed
        those things down I was able to move ahead.

        <strong>Take away</strong>: Creating a sitemap for the website had its
        challenges, but I was able to overcome them by sticking closely to the
        content strategy document. At this point, it was real easy to have
        scope creep and veer off course.

        having to input the data a second time. It wasn’t clear if the “free
        plan” was actually free, etc). Overall the suggested changes to the
        prototype were minor. I made those changes and implemented them in the
        high fidelity mockups.

        participants for this testing as I did in the Lo-Fi user testing
        phase. They were excited to see the process go from unrefined to this

        It reminded me of something that was strong, safe and trusted by most
        people. Moving further into the branding process, I began sketching
        out logo ideas for the design that would best represent the product. I
        came up with several ideas that I thought would work but chose the

      <h4 class="thoughts">MY THOUGHTS</h4>

      <p class="thoughts-text1">
        UX design has many parts and putting all those parts together to come
        up with a workable solution was challenging.
        <strong>I have grown a lot through this process and gained valuable insight
          into the design process</strong>. Having minimal information on a final product and no content
        presented its own set of challenges. I learned that what worked best
        for me was to knock it down one phase at a time and to just trust the
        process.
      </p>

      <p class="thoughts-text2">
        What didn’t work was to try and have it all figured out right from the
        beginning.
        <strong>A mistake I made and realized later was I didn’t necessarily follow
          my data with regards to who my target audience should be
          (women)</strong>. I wanted it to convey strength and security, but at the same time
        be fun and inviting. I tested my solution on more men than women, and
        therefore I feel the design may have taken on a more masculine feel
        instead of feminine.
        <strong>The logo is very masculine, but in my mind, I saw
          <i>“strong imagery”</i> as noted by some of my testers</strong>. The young lady I tested felt that the site
        was
        <i>“inviting and calming”</i>, and thought the color choice was
        <i>“spot on”</i>.
      </p>

      <p class="thoughts-text3">
        If I had more time to work on this project I would have gotten more
        creative with some of the features that I offered in my solution. Data
        showed that some participants indicated that they would like to see
        newer technology used.
        <strong>Something critical that I found out from users is that even in this
          era of technology, there are still so many people who could care
          less about it and didn’t feel it was necessary for them to conduct
          their life functions</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="thoughts-text4">
        In summary, what I learned through this process was that “yes…, I can
        do this”. No, it’s not perfection, but there is room for
        growth.<strong>
          I believe my final solution solves user's main concern of data
          security by implementing 2FA and by adding more collaboration
          functionality</strong>. There’s much to learn to become a great UX Designer. While all
        things present challenges, if I don’t give up and continue to
        persevere, I can be successful in my endeavor.
        <strong>What surprised me the most, and what I truly didn’t understand, was
          the level of work it actually takes to produce an MVP</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="thoughts-text5">
        I will use this experience and the knowledge gained through this
        process to continue learning, so I can be a part of creating useful
        and delightful user experiences for future product users.
